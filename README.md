This project comprises of an Android app written in Kotlin that sends a location ping to a web server coded in JS(running locally and forwarded using ngrok) with a web client using Google Maps API to display the location of the android device on the map. The web server can handle multiple devices sending location data and the server assigns each device a unique ID and shows the location of the device on the web server. The server also keeps a history of location data sent to it by each device and can draw the path which the device took based of the previous location data.
